### Data
  * The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. Visit the USGS GeoJSON Feed page and pick a data set to visualize. When you click on a data set, for example 'All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days', you will be given a JSON representation of that data. You will be using the URL of this JSON to pull in the data for our visualization.
  * Data on tectonic plates can be found at <https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates>.



# Earthquake
The United States Geological Survey, or USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

The Earthquake App is used to retreive data from USGS, and to visualize the earthquake data.
